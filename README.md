CherryPy image generation

Cherry Py is a python package that goes somewhat further than the simple web server. 
This is a little example that demonstrates how it can be used to serve programmatically generated images 
to the client's browser (I couldn't find any examples on the web for how to do this so having worked out a 
way to do it I have added the solution to my git repository).

The key feature of this simple example is that it serves the image to a web browser 
withouth having to save the images to the server's file space first.
